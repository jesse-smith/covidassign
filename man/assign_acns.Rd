}
\description{
\code{assign_acns()} divides unassigned cases among REDcap investigators
scheduled to work on \code{date}. It distributes cases randomly and evenly across
investigators until either all are assigned or there are too few cases for
another round of even distribution. Any remaining cases are assigned randomly
with at most one additional case given to an investigator.
