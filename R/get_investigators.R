#' Join Investigators Listed in Investigation Schedule & Case Assignment Project
#'
#' `get_investigators()` joins the investigators scheduled to work on
#' `date` with the list of investigators from the \strong{Case Assignment}
#' REDcap project. By default, it performs an inner join, since only
#' investigators in both lists are available for case assignment.
#'
#' While the default behavior is an inner join, `get_investigators()` can
#' also perform anti-joins with either the scheduled or REDcap investigator list
#' as the primary table. This is useful for debugging and checking that all
#' scheduled investigators are able to have cases assigned.

#' @inheritParams download_redcap_investigators
#'
#' @param type The type of join to use. `"inner"` returns only investigators in
#'   both lists (the default). `"anti_join_scheduled"` returns investigators who
#'   are scheduled but not listed in REDcap; `"anti_join_redcap"` returns
#'   investigators who are listed in REDcap but not scheduled.
#'
#' @param quiet Should update messages be suppressed?
#'
#' @return A `tibble` with one row per investigator and an `investigator`
#'   column. If `type = "inner"`, an `id` column is also included.
