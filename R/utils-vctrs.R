#' vctrs: Vector Helpers
#'
#' The vctrs package defines new notions of prototype and size that are used to
#' provide tools for consistent and well-founded type-coercion and
#' size-recycling, and are in turn connected to ideas of type- and
#' size-stability useful for analyzing function interfaces. See the vctrs
#' site at \url{https://vctrs.r-lib.org/} for more information.
#'
#' This package is imported directly to encourage development using the
#' standardized helpers it provides. This decision may be re-thought at a later
#' date.
